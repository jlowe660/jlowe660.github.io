>The Lakers plethora of championships in Minneapolis began in 1949, led by George Mikan. The Lakers would move on to win the next four out of five, only missing the 1951 championship. The Lakers would not win a championship in the 1960s. In the 1949 Finals, George Mikan broke his wrist and still scored 22 points in Game 5. They won the series in six games, where Mikan had 29 in the elimination game. The Lakers won in six again the following year, defeating the Syracuse Nationals, today's 76ers. The Lakers beat the Knicks in seven in 1952, with Mikan dominating in the series again. 1953 was almost identical, except the Lakers closed in five. The Lakers would beat the Nationals again in 1954.

>The Lakers wouldn't see another championship until Los Angeles in 1972. The Lakers defeated the Knicks once again in five games. The Lakers were led by all-time greats Wilt Chamberlain and Jerry West (The Logo). However, the Lakers would struggle until Showtime. The Lakers acquired Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in the 1975 offseason, and would eventually become the NBA's leading scorer until LeBron James passed Abdul-Jabbar in February 2023. Then, in 1979, the Lakers drafted Magic Johnson first overall, one of the worst mistakes another franchise made that benefited the Lakers. The Lakers would move on to win five Finals in the 1980s, which is considered to be one of the most dominating decades outside of the 1960s (Celtics) and the 1990s (Bulls). The Lakers would win in 1980, 1982, 1985, 1987, and 1988. The Finals MVPs included Johnson three times and Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy once.

>The Lakers would go dormant again in the 1990s, as they lacked starpower to compete in a strong Western Conference. The NBA also picked up during the 1990s, as there was more parity and it became more entertaining. However, the Lakers would acquire Kobe Bryant via trade during the 1996 NBA draft, as well as Shaquille O'Neal in free agency in the 1996 offseason. These two, including Derek Fisher, Nick Van Exel, and Robert Horry, became a tale to tell. Robert Horry won seven Finals as a player, and is well-known for being one of the best role players of all time. The Lakers would move on to win the 2000, 2001, and 2002 Finals, dominating all competition along the way. O'Neal and Bryant began to have locker room problems, forcing the Lakers to trade O'Neal to Miami after their 2004 Finals loss to the Detroit Pistons. This series was heavily favored for the Lakers, and them losing it proved to management there needed to be a change.
