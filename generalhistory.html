The Los Angeles Lakers started as the Detroit Gems in 1946 before moving to Minneapolis and becoming the Lakers in 1947. The 1947-48 season was the inaugural season of what would become the NBA. They would win five championships in the six years, missing the 1951 championship to the Rochester Royals, today's Sacramento Kings. Minneapolis didn't support the Lakers well, forcing their move to Los Angeles for the 1960-61 season. The 1960s were dominated by the Boston Celtics, who won every title but the 1967 title. This began the long-time, well-known rivalry of the Lakers and the Celtics. Some key players from the 1960s for the Lakers include Jerry West and Elgin Baylor.

The Lakers got back on the title board with a championship in 1972. Wilt Chamberlain, considered one of the best to ever play, averaged 19 points and 23 rebounds in the Finals series versus the New York Knicks. Other supporting cast include Jerry West, Pat Riley (who would become one of the Laker's greatest coaches, coaching "Showtime Lakers"), and Gail Goodrich. While the Lakers struggled following their 1972 championship, they did acquire Kareem Abdul-Jabbar via trade from the Milwaukee Bucks, who had already earned three MVPs. The Lakers took all-time great PG Magic Johnson first overall in the 1979 draft, and the Lakers would move on to win five titles in the 1980s, continuing to strengthen their rivalry with the Celtics.

The 1990s weren't as historical for the Lakers, as the decade was dominated by the Chicago Bulls and Houston Rockets. However, in 1996, the Lakers acquired Kobe Bryant via trade on draft night. Bryant would become one of the greatest to ever play, winning five NBA championships, three to begin the 2000s with also all-time great Shaquille O'Neal. Kobe Bryant would continue to dominate the NBA, winning two more championships in 2009 and 2010, beating the Magic and Celtics, respectively. After Kobe Bryant's first injury in 2012, the Lakers would struggle immensely until the 2019-20 season, where they would win their 17th championship, led by LeBron James and Anthony Davis.
